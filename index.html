          So, in this video, Kurzgesagt tells us about climate change, whch by 2030, might eventually
          kil us. To prevent this from happening, he explains about Geoengineering, which might do
          two things- either save humanity or end it. It has many ways to stop sun rays from reaching
          the hottest and coldest parts of the world to prevent glaciers from melting and bringing the 
          earth's temperature down to NOT turn it into a fireball, like Venus.(Venus also used to be like
          Earth, with living life and water, with  a livable atmosphere.). So, by hearing this it is already
          really easy to tell weather it is a bad or a good idea. If we even mess up a little bit, the sun
          rays could stop coming to earth completely and turn earth into an iceball. So, this is the basic
          of what is explained in the video and how scientists are also still developing this method but it may
          be ready by the end of 2022.
